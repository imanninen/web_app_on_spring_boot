# web_app_on_spring_boot
I decided to implement web app using spring boot and kotlin. I understand that logs - means info about commits.
So, I implement a web application, that shows you all commits in selected repository in main branch.
To run it locally you need to clone this repo and run code. Web app will be launched at localhost on port 8080.

I did not concentrate on building frontend, so just use prepared css.
